#### Tee command
The tee command in Linux (and other Unix-like systems) is a powerful utility that allows you to simultaneously display output on the standard output (your terminal) and save it to one or more files.

Think of it like a "T" pipe fitting in plumbing â€“ it splits the flow of data.
It can perform redirection but display out over the screen as well.
```bash
$ echo $SHELL | tee shell.txt # to write and display
$ echo $HOME | tee -a shell.txt # to append and display
```
